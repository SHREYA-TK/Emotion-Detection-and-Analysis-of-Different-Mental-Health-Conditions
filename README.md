# Emotion-Detection-and-Analysis-of-Different-Mental-Health-Conditions
Emotions play a critical role in mental health, and understanding emotional expressions can offer deep insights into an individualâ€™s mental state. This project aims to develop a model capable of detecting and quantifying emotions in textual data using Machine Learning and Natural Language Processing (NLP). These insights will contribute to personalized mental health support by identifying emotional intensity, enabling more precise, timely, and tailored treatments for individuals based on their unique emotional profiles, resulting in proactive mental health management. The broader implications of this research lie in its potential to enhance therapeutic tools, such as automated counsellors or virtual mental health assistants, which can assess emotional health in real time and provide support to individuals in need.
